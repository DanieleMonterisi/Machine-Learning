Wine classiﬁcation is a diﬃcult task since taste is the least understood of the human senses [2]. The aim of this work is to establish whether it is possible to implement an automatic system of wine quality classiﬁcation, in order to support decision-making processes; we propose a data mining approach to predict human wine taste preferences based on physicochemical properties from wine analyses. The question to be answered is: is it possible to predict wine quality eﬀectively and automatically?


In this study a predictive modeling of wine quality and performance evaluation of diﬀerent classiﬁcation models is presented in order to use a model that classiﬁes as correctly as possible the quality of Portoguese ”Vinho Verde” red wine.
